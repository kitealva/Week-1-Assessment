    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This step we need to understand what really needs to be done. We need to establish the needs before it is too late."

const design = "This step we need to make plans on how we want to move forward on building the said software and how we can maintain the life cycle of the design."

const implementation = "This step we want to is fine tuning to software to the clients needs, and help teach how our project works if needed."

const testingAndIntergration = "This step we need to test the software before it is delivered to said client. Does it work? Is it easy to use? Is it fast or is it slow?"

const maintain = "This step we need to make sure if there were any missed bugs/poor code gets fixed to maintain the integrity of the code."
